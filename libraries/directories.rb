    # Chef has a bug (http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1327)
    # When the "directory" command is used with "recursive = true",
    # only the deepest directory obtains the ownership specified
    # by the block.  For example,
    #   directory "a/b/c" do
    #     owner "foo"
    #     recursive true
    #   end
    # creates directories "a" and "a/b" owned by root, and "a/b/c"
    # owned by "foo".
    # To avoid this, the following command takes a
    # list of implicitly nested directories, and creates each one
    # individually.  For example,
    #   recursive_directories ['a', 'b', 'c'] do
    #     owner "foo"
    #   end
    # Will create the directories "a", "a/b" and "a/b/c", each
    # owned by "foo".
    def recursive_directories(dirs, &block)
      dirs.each_index do |i|
        directory(File.join(dirs[0..i]), &block)
      end
    end
  end
end
